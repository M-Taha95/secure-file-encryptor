# 🔐 Secure File Encryption & Decryption Tool  
### An Interactive Cybersecurity Learning Platform for Students — Built with **Python** and **Flask**

---

## 📘 Project Overview

The **Secure File Encryption & Decryption Tool** is a complete cybersecurity learning platform that combines:

- Real AES-GCM file encryption  
- A child-friendly educational experience  
- Interactive animation-based cryptography lessons  
- A casino-style cipher game with 20+ random challenges  
- A leaderboard system for student motivation  

This project is designed for school children and beginners who want to learn cybersecurity concepts in a fun, safe, and modern way.

It demonstrates how cryptographic algorithms like **AES-GCM** and **PBKDF2** are used to secure sensitive files, using a clean and intuitive web interface.

## 🧠 Key Features

### 🔒 AES-GCM Encryption  
Industry-standard AES encryption with authentication to prevent tampering.

### 🔑 Password & Keyfile Support  
Choose between:
- Password-based encryption  
- A 32-byte AES keyfile (`.key`)

### 🧬 PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256  
Secure password strengthening (390,000 iterations).

### 💻 Local-Only Processing  
All operations happen **on your own device** — nothing is uploaded.

### 🎓 Learning Pages  
- Cyber-Robot Academy  
- Animated cipher explanations  
- Caesar, ROT13, XOR, Atbash, Substitution  
- Step-by-step transformation animations  

### 🎰 Cipher Casino Game

## 🧩 Technical Stack

| Category         | Technology                                               |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Backend**      | Python, Flask                                            |
| **Cryptography** | AES-GCM, PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 (`cryptography` library)     |
| **Frontend**     | HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript                                  |
| **Environment**  | `.env` configuration using `python-dotenv`               |

## ⚙️ How It Works

The system supports two encryption flows:

| Mode              | Description |
| ----------------- | ----------- |
| **Password Mode** | User-provided password is turned into a strong AES key using PBKDF2. |
| **Keyfile Mode**  | A downloaded `.key` file containing a 32-byte AES key is used directly. |

### 🔑 Keyfile Generation
Use the **“Generate New Keyfile”** button to download a secure AES keyfile.

Keep it safe — it is needed for decrypting files encrypted with that key.

#Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt



🧩 Usage Guide
🔐 Encrypt a File

Upload any file (PDF, image, video, Word, etc.)

Enter password or upload keyfile

Choose Encrypt

Download your encrypted .enc file

🔓 Decrypt a File

Upload the .enc file

Use the same password or keyfile

Choose Decrypt

Your original file is restored

🔒 Security Notes

If you lose the .key file, the encrypted data cannot be recovered

All processing happens locally — nothing is uploaded

Strong passwords increase security

AES-GCM prevents tampering and ensures integrity
